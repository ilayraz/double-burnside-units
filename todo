* Check if any branches fail
* For each isomorphism class (up to centralizer and normalizer) how many branches?
* Take quotient with isoms from single burnside ring

* Find order+index of subgroup with only identity isomorphism as basis
* write isom finder without smallgroup

N_G(V)
m = U\G/N_G(V)
m * O(N_G(V))/O(V) = m*[N_G(V) : V]
